          Today you will read the story "The Honeyguide's Revenge." &nbsp;This story is a folktale told by the Zulu people in Africa. &nbsp;A folktale is a traditional 
          story that is passed down from one generation to another by word of mouth. &nbsp;Folktales usually explain something. &nbsp;Often folktales are a 
          way for older people to teach young people how to survive and prosper in the local environment. &nbsp;After you have read the story you can think about what you have learned about living in Africa.

Why should I share any of this lovely honey with you?” Then he walked off. Ngede was furious! This was no way to treat him! But he would get his revenge.</div>

        <div class="words">Gingile climbed, wondering why he didn’t hear the usual buzzing. “Perhaps the hive is deep in the tree,” he thought to himself. He pulled himself up another branch.

        <div class="words">Before Leopard could take a swipe at Gingile, he rushed down the tree. In his hurry he missed a branch, and landed with a heavy thud on the ground twisting his ankle.
